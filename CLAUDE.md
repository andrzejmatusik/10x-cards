### Guidelines for REACT

#### REACT_CODING_STANDARDS

- Use functional components with hooks instead of class components
- Implement React.memo() for expensive components that render often with the same props
- Utilize React.lazy() and Suspense for code-splitting and performance optimization
- Use the useCallback hook for event handlers passed to child components to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Prefer useMemo for expensive calculations to avoid recomputation on every render
- Implement useId() for generating unique IDs for accessibility attributes
- Use the new use hook for data fetching in React 19+ projects
- Consider using the new useOptimistic hook for optimistic UI updates in forms
- Use useTransition for non-urgent state updates to keep the UI responsive

### Guidelines for ASTRO

#### ASTRO_CODING_STANDARDS

- Use Astro components (.astro) for static content and layout
- Leverage View Transitions API for smooth page transitions
- Use content collections with type safety for blog posts, documentation, etc.
- Implement middleware for request/response modification
- Use image optimization with the Astro Image integration
- Leverage Server Endpoints for API routes
- Implement hybrid rendering with server-side rendering where needed
- Use Astro.cookies for server-side cookie management
- Leverage import.meta.env for environment variables
